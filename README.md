</p>


Germinal is a pipeline for designing de novo antibodies against specified epitopes on target proteins. The pipeline follows a 3-step process: hallucination based on ColabDesign, selective sequence redesign with AbMPNN, and cofolding with a structure prediction model. Germinal is capable of designing both nanobodies and scFvs against user-specified residues on target proteins. 

We describe Germinal in the preprint: ["Efficient generation of epitope-targeted de novo antibodies with Germinal"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.19.677421v1)

**⚠️ We are still actively working on code improvements.**

- We strongly recommend use of [AF3](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold3) for design filtering as done in the paper, as **filters are only calibrated for AF3 confidence metrics**. We are actively working to add Chai calibrated thresholds for commercial users. Until then, running Germinal with `structure_model: "chai"` and NOT `structure_model: "af3"` should be considered experimental and may have lower passing rates.
- While nanobody design is fully functional and validated experimentally, the configs and filters for scFvs remain preliminary; this functionality should therefore still be regarded as experimental.
- As recommended in the preprint, we suggest performing a small parameter sweep before launching full sampling runs. This is especially important when working with a new target or selecting a new epitope. In `configs/run/vhh_pdl1.yaml` and `configs/run/vhh_il3.yaml`, we provide the parameters that we used for PD-L1 and IL3 nanobody generations in the pre-print. We also include the filters used for these runs under `configs/filter/initial/` and `configs/filter/final/`. In `configs/run/vhh.yaml` and `configs/run/scfv.yaml` we provide a set of reasonable default parameters that we used as a starting point for parameter exploration and sweep experiments (see below **Important Notes and Tips for Design** for more details). Note that final sampling runs in the preprint all used slightly modified parameters. Parameters can be configured from the command line. For example, you can set `weights_beta` and `weights_plddt` with the following command:

```bash
python run_germinal.py weights_beta=0.3 weights_plddt=1.0
```

1. Ensure you have an NVIDIA GPU with a recent driver (recommended CUDA 12+). You can verify with:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```
2. Install Miniconda or Anaconda if not already available.

3. Follow the **instructions** in `environment_setup.md`

4. Copy AlphaFold-Multimer parameters to `params/` and untar them. 
   Alternatively, you can run the following lines inside `params/` to download and untar:
   ```bash
   aria2c -x 16 https://storage.googleapis.com/alphafold/alphafold_params_2022-12-06.tar
   tar -xf alphafold_params_2022-12-06.tar -C .
   ```

5. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate germinal
   ```

6. (Optional) Run validation at any time to ensure all packages have installed correctly:
   ```bash
   python validate_install.py
   ```

Notes:
- AlphaFold-Multimer and AlphaFold3 parameters are large and must be downloaded manually.

<!-- TOC --><a name=docker"></a>
### Docker
Germinal can be run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t germinal .
docker run -it --rm --gpus all \
  -v "$PWD/results:/workspace/results" \
  -v "$PWD/pdbs:/workspace/pdbs" \
  germinal bash
```

and Singularity (shown)/Apptainer:
```bash
mkdir -p results
singularity pull germinal.sif docker://jwang003/germinal:latest
singularity shell --nv \
  --bind "$PWD/results:/workspace/results" \
  --bind "$PWD/pdbs:/workspace/pdbs" \
  --pwd /workspace \
  germinal.sif
```
> **Note:** Pulling may hang on `Creating SIF file...` If so, check if the command is done with `singularity exec germinal.sif python -c "print('ok')"`

Volumes are mounted to save generated input complexes and results from sampling.

Once inside the container you can test:
```bash
python run_germinal.py
```

## Usage

<!-- TOC --><a name="quick-start"></a>
### Quick Start

The main entry point to the pipeline is `run_germinal.py`. Germinal uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for orchestrating different configurations. An example main configuration file is located in `configs/config.yaml`. This yaml file contains high level run parameters as well as pointers to more granular configuration settings.

These detailed options are stored in four main settings files:

 - **Main run settings**: `configs/run/vhh.yaml`
 - **Target settings**: `configs/target/[your_target].yaml`
 - **Post-hallucination (initial) filters**: `configs/filter/initial/default.yaml`
 - **Final filters**: `configs/filters/final/default.yaml`

``` 

To design nanobodies targeting PD-L1 using default configs:

```bash
python run_germinal.py
```

To design scFvs targeting PD-L1 using default configs:

```bash
python run_germinal.py run=scfv filter/initial=scfv filter/final=scfv
```
> **Note:** Default configs are not meant to work well out of the box but rather be a set of reasonable default parameters that we used as a starting point for parameter exploration and sweep experiments.

If you wish to change the configuration of runs, you can:

 - create an entirely new config yaml
 - swap one of the four main settings files
 - pass specific overrides

<!-- TOC --><a name="basic-usage"></a>
### Basic Usage

**Run with defaults:**
```bash
python run_germinal.py
```

**Switch to a different run config (e.g., new_config):**
```bash
python run_germinal.py run=new_config
```

**Use different target:**
```bash
python run_germinal.py target=my_target
```

**Use a different config file with Hydra:**
```bash
python run_germinal.py --config_name new_config.yaml
```

**Use different filters:**
```bash
python run_germinal.py filter/initial=new_init_filter filter/final=new_final_filter
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="cli-overrides"></a>
### CLI Overrides

Hydra provides powerful CLI override capabilities. You can override any parameter in any configuration file.

> **!NOTE** Settings in `configs/run/` folder use the global namespace and do not need a `run` prefix before overriding. See example below.

**Basic parameter overrides:**
```bash
# Override trajectory limits
python run_germinal.py max_trajectories=100 max_passing_designs=50

# Override experiment settings
python run_germinal.py experiment_name=my_experiment run_config=test_run

# Override loss weights. Note: no run prefix since run settings are global
python run_germinal.py weights_plddt=1.5 weights_iptm=0.8 
```

**Filter threshold overrides:**
```bash
# Make initial filters less stringent
python run_germinal.py filter.initial.clashes.value=2

# Adjust final filter thresholds
python run_germinal.py filter.final.external_plddt.value=0.9 filter.final.external_iptm.value=0.8

# Change filter operators
python run_germinal.py filter.final.sc_rmsd.operator='<=' filter.final.sc_rmsd.value=5.0
```

**Target configuration overrides:**
```bash
# Change target hotspots
python run_germinal.py target.target_hotspots=\'A26,A30,A36,A44\'

# Use different PDB file
python run_germinal.py target.target_pdb_path=\'pdbs/my_target.pdb\' target.target_name=\'my_target\'
```

**Complex multi-parameter overrides:**
```bash
# Complete scFv run with custom settings
python run_germinal.py \
  run=scfv \
  target=pdl1 \
  max_trajectories=500 \
  experiment_name=\'scfv_pdl1_test\' \
  target.target_hotspots=\'A37,A39,A41\' \
  filter.final.external_plddt.value=0.85 \
  weights_iptm=1.0
```


<!-- TOC --><a name="target-configuration"></a>
### Target Configuration

For each new target, you will need to define a target settings yaml file which contains all relevant information about the target protin. Here is an example:

```yaml
target_name: "pdl1"
target_pdb_path: "pdbs/pdl1.pdb"
target_chain: "A"
binder_chain: "B"
target_hotspots: "25,26,39,41"
dimer: false  # support coming soon!
length: 133
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="filters-configuration"></a>
### Filters Configuration

There are two sets of filters: post-hallucination (initial) filters and final filters. The post-hallucination filters are applied after the hallucination step to determine which sequences to proceed to the redesign step. This filter set is a subset of the final filters, which is applied at the end of the pipeline to determine passing antibody sequences. Here is an example of the post-hallucination filters:
```yaml
clashes:
  value: 1
  operator: '<'

sc_rmsd:
  value: 7.0
  operator: '<'

binder_near_hotspot:
  value: true
  operator: '=='
```

## Output Format

Germinal generates organized output directories:

```
runs/your_target_nb_20240101_120000/
├── final_config.yaml           # Complete run configuration after overrides
├── trajectories/               # Results for trajectories which pass hallucination but fail the first set of filters
│   ├── structures/     
│   ├── plots/            
│   └── designs.csv      
├── redesign_candidates/        # Results for trajectories which are AbMPNN redesigned but fail the final set of filters
│   ├── structures/          
│   └── designs.csv           
├── accepted/                   # Antibodies that pass all filters
│   ├── structures/          
│   └── designs.csv           
├── all_trajectories.csv        # Main CSV containing designs in all three folders above
└── failure_counts.csv          # CSV logging # trajectories failing each step of hallucination
```

**Key Output Files:**
- `accepted/structures/*.pdb` - Final antibody-antigen structure for passing antibody designs.
- `all_trajectories.csv` - Complete list of designs that passed hallucination, their *in silico* metrics, which stage they reached, and the pdb path to the designed structure.

## Important Notes and Tips for Design

Hallucination is inherently expensive. Designing against a 130 residue target takes anywhere from 2-8 minutes for a nanobody design iteration on an H100 80GB GPU, depending on which stage the designed sequence reaches. For 40GB GPUs or scFvs, this number is around 50% larger.

During sampling, we typically run antibody generation until there are around 1,000 passing designs against the specified target and observe a success rate of around ~1 per GPU hour. Of those, we typically select the top 40-50 sequences for experimental testing based on a combination of *in silico* metrics described in the preprint. While *in silico* success rates vary wildly across targets, we estimate that 200-400 H100 80GB GPU hours of sampling are typically enough to generate ~200 successful designs and some functional antibodies. 

**Tweaking Parameters:**

Optimal design parameters are different for each target and antibody type! If you are experiencing low success rates, we recommend tweaking interface confidence weights (ipTM / iPAE), structure-based weights (helix, beta, framework loss), or the IgLM weights defined in `iglm_scale`.  In particular we recommend playing around with:

```python
weights_plddt: 1.0
weights_pae_inter: 0.5
weights_iptm: 0.7
weights_helix: 0.1
weights_beta: 0.1
framework_contact_offset: 1
```

`iglm_scale` is a key parameter that controls the influence of IgLM during different stages of the design process. `iglm_scale` is defined as a list of four scalar values: `[v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4]`. During the logits phase, iglm_scale increases linearly between v_1 and v_2. During the softmax phase, iglm_scale takes the value of v_3, and during the semi-greedy stage iglm_scale takes the value of v_4. 

Filters are also easily changeable in the filters configurations. To add or remove filters from the initial and final filtering rounds, simply create a new filter with the same name as the intended metric and specify the threshold value and the operator (<, >, =, etc).

Finally, using omit_AAs - e.g. `omit_AAs: "C,A"` in the yaml or `omit_AAs="'C,A'"` in the command line (note the double quotation for hydra) - allows one to omit any amino acid from appearing in the CDRs, opposed to all of the protein.

An example of a param sweep could be:

```bash
python run_germinal.py weights_beta=0.1 weights_helix=0.1 weights_plddt=1.0 experiment_name=beta01-helix01-plddt1

python run_germinal.py weights_beta=0.3 weights_helix=0.2 weights_plddt=1.5 experiment_name=beta03-helix02-plddt1.5
...
```
