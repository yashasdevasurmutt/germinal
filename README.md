</p>


Germinal is a pipeline for designing de novo antibodies against specified epitopes on target proteins. The pipeline follows a 3-step process: hallucination based on ColabDesign, selective sequence redesign with AbMPNN, and cofolding with a structure prediction model. Germinal is capable of designing both nanobodies and scFvs against user-specified residues on target proteins. 

We describe Germinal in the preprint: ["Efficient generation of epitope-targeted de novo antibodies with Germinal"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.09.19.677421v1)

**⚠️ We are still actively working on code improvements.**

### Installation

1. Ensure you have an NVIDIA GPU with a recent driver (recommended CUDA 12+). You can verify with:
   ```bash
   nvidia-smi
   ```
2. Install Miniconda or Anaconda if not already available.

3. Follow the instructions in `environment_setup.md`

## Usage

<!-- TOC --><a name="quick-start"></a>
### Quick Start

The main entry point to the pipeline is `run_germinal.py`. Germinal uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) for orchestrating different configurations. An example main configuration file is located in `configs/config.yaml`. This yaml file contains high level run parameters as well as pointers to more granular configuration settings.

These detailed options are stored in four main settings files:

 - **Main run settings**: `configs/run/vhh.yaml`
 - **Target settings**: `configs/target/[your_target].yaml`
 - **Post-hallucination (initial) filters**: `configs/filter/initial/default.yaml`
 - **Final filters**: `configs/filters/final/default.yaml`

<!-- TOC --><a name="configuration-structure"></a>
#### Configuration Structure

```
configs/
├── config.yaml              # Main configuration yaml
├── run/                     # Main run settings
│   ├── vhh.yaml             # VHH (nanobody) specific settings
│   └── scfv.yaml            # scFv specific settings
├── target/                  # Target protein configurations
│   └── pdl1.yaml            # PDL1 target example
└── filter/                  # Filter configurations
    ├── initial/
    │   └── default.yaml     # Post-hallucination (initial) filters
    └── final/
        ├── default.yaml     # Final acceptance filters
        └── scfv.yaml        # Final filters for scfv runs
```

In general, the main run settings and filters should stay the same and can be run as defaults unless you are experimenting. To design nanobodies targeting PD-L1, simply run:

```bash
python run_germinal.py
```

To design scFvs targeting PD-L1, run:

```bash
python run_germinal.py run=scfv filter.initial=scfv
```

If you wish to change the configuration of runs, you can:

 - create an entirely new config yaml
 - swap one of the four main settings files
 - pass specific overrides

<!-- TOC --><a name="basic-usage"></a>
### Basic Usage

**Run with defaults (VHH + PDL1 + default filters):**
```bash
python run_germinal.py
```

**Switch to scFv:**
```bash
python run_germinal.py run=scfv
```

**Use different target:**
```bash
python run_germinal.py target=my_target
```

**Use a different config file with Hydra:**
```bash
python run_germinal.py --config_name new_config.yaml
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="cli-overrides"></a>
### CLI Overrides

Hydra provides powerful CLI override capabilities. You can override any parameter in any configuration file.

> [!NOTE]
> Settings in `configs/run/` folder use the global namespace and do not need a `run` prefix before overriding. See example below.

**Basic parameter overrides:**
```bash
# Override trajectory limits
python run_germinal.py max_trajectories=100 max_passing_designs=50

# Override experiment settings
python run_germinal.py experiment_name=my_experiment run_config=test_run

# Override loss weights. Note: no run prefix since run settings are global
python run_germinal.py weights_plddt=1.5 weights_iptm=0.8 
```

**Filter threshold overrides:**
```bash
# Make initial filters less stringent
python run_germinal.py filter.initial.clashes.value=2

# Adjust final filter thresholds
python run_germinal.py filter.final.external_plddt.value=0.9 filter.final.external_iptm.value=0.8

# Change filter operators
python run_germinal.py filter.final.sc_rmsd.operator='<=' filter.final.sc_rmsd.value=5.0
```

**Target configuration overrides:**
```bash
# Change target hotspots
python run_germinal.py target.target_hotspots="A26,A30,A36,A44"

# Use different PDB file
python run_germinal.py target.target_pdb_path="pdbs/my_target.pdb" target.target_name="my_target"
```

**Complex multi-parameter overrides:**
```bash
# Complete scFv run with custom settings
python run_germinal.py \
  run=scfv \
  target=pdl1 \
  max_trajectories=500 \
  experiment_name="scfv_pdl1_test" \
  target.target_hotspots="A37,A39,A41" \
  filter.final.external_plddt.value=0.85 \
  weights_iptm=1.0
```


<!-- TOC --><a name="target-configuration"></a>
### Target Configuration

For each new target, you will need to define a target settings yaml file which contains all relevant information about the target protin. Here is an example:

```yaml
target_name: "pdl1"
target_pdb_path: "pdbs/pdl1.pdb"
target_chain: "A"
binder_chain: "B"
target_hotspots: "25,26,39,41"
dimer: false  # support coming soon!
length: 133
```

<!-- TOC --><a name="filters-configuration"></a>
### Filters Configuration

There are two sets of filters: post-hallucination (initial) filters and final filters. The post-hallucination filters are applied after the hallucination step to determine which sequences to proceed to the redesign step. This filter set is a subset of the final filters, which is applied at the end of the pipeline to determine passing antibody sequences. Here is an example of the post-hallucination filters:
```yaml
clashes: {'value': 1, 'operator': '<'}
cdr3_hotspot_contacts: {'value': 0, 'operator': '>'}
percent_interface_cdr: {'value': 0.5, 'operator': '>'}
interface_shape_comp: {'value': 0.6, 'operator': '>'}
```

## Output Format

Germinal generates organized output directories:

```
runs/your_target_nb_20240101_120000/
├── final_config.yaml           # Complete run configuration after overrides
├── trajectories/               # Results for trajectories which pass hallucination but fail the first set of filters
│   ├── structures/     
│   ├── plots/            
│   └── designs.csv      
├── redesign_candidates/        # Results for trajectories which are AbMPNN redesigned but fail the final set of filters
│   ├── structures/          
│   └── designs.csv           
├── accepted/                   # Antibodies that pass all filters
│   ├── structures/          
│   └── designs.csv           
├── all_trajectories.csv        # Main CSV containing designs in all three folders above
└── failure_counts.csv          # CSV logging # trajectories failing each step of hallucination
```

**Key Output Files:**
- `accepted/structures/*.pdb` - Final antibody-antigen structure for passing antibody designs.
- `all_trajectories.csv` - Complete list of designs that passed hallucination, their *in silico* metrics, which stage they reached, and the pdb path to the designed structure.

## Tips for Design

Hallucination is inherently expensive. Designing against a 130 residue target takes anywhere from 3-8 minutes for a nanobody design iteration, depending on which stage the hallucinated sequence reaches. For scFvs, this number is around 50% larger.

During sampling, we typically run antibody generation until there are around 1,000 passing designs against the specified target. Of those, we typically select the top 40-50 sequences for experimental testing based on a combination of *in silico* metrics described in the preprint. While *in silico* success rates vary wildly across targets, we estimate that 200-300 H100 80GB GPU hours of sampling are typically enough to discover some functional antibodies. 

More tips coming soon!
